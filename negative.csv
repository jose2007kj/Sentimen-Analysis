warning spoilers included review doesnt really make much difference deep impact begins official summer movie season also brings back memories remember dantes peak came february months later volcano released first film smart one best disaster films ever seen latter film mess logic wasted talent well deja vu two disaster films go head head competition time unfortunately first comet flick bad people may shy away armageddon upcoming released beginning july course general reaction audience mine minority stood side dantes peak watching deep impact began wonder anyone right mind could actually like film apparently many utterly completely honest havent little fun watching disaster film entire life volcano implausibilities still rather fun watch deep impact doesnt implausibilities also contains cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effects poorly constructed plot thing gives half star bottom slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes good actors making characters deep impact begins unnamed year year advanced technology sets future fire sky showing local movie theater pushing back line students outside night dark sky among leo elijah wood sarah leelee sobieski leo

reveal comet public plans send massive spacecraft destroy arrive announce plan called ark hope survival computer select people random people ones go large cave underground impact comet wont kill entire human race two years dust settle actually would take much much ninety years understand humans could come back surface start rest plot standard disaster film one subplot worth mentioning jenny father jason schell touching relationship forms impending doom final moment involving two characters heartfelt emotional shame nothing else heartfelt course know comet impact surface title alone suggests previews actually show tension drawn attempt stop comet know wont work director mimi leder came successful tries direction episodes hit television show er major film debut peacemaker pathetic heartless action film well time leder creating film worse one suggestion ms leder please stay away big screen least action genre much blame placed leder directly pace disastrously throughout film given subtitles tell us much time passed goes months weeks hours literally feels like time taking place boring course leder isnt blame screenwriters michael bruce joel rubin crafted simplistic story gets worse time starts promising soon turns deadly audience anyway chock full cheesy one liners know going sex anyone else school stupid characters might think back one subplots remotely interesting rest forgettable boring main plot outrageous cant figure film supposed action drama scifi put simply special effects film hit miss situation thats right miss hit scenes earth well done ship comet huge mistake making laughable frightening concept even trying land comet preposterous enough thats isnt actually humans walk surface give break ya course much hyped collision comet earth well far spectacular makes independence day look brilliant water rushing towards land effective hits continent effects turn ridiculous cgi water used looks bad heard laughs audience fact may even recommend film want see bad effects actually get days think visual effects cant improved along comes film show really one thing struck wrong note concerning mimi direction also influences actors leder loves show actors faces moments terror reminded another action director renny harlin die hard cliffhanger harlin succeeds shows faces victims realistic situations leder likes flaunt peoples fears via faces instead coming sympathetic leder seems one moment astronaut flying space enough warrant response audience leder wants go farther shows us persons face drifting space one ways emotional response audience one going fooled another note film picks pace last fifteen minutes comet actually pace pick emotional moments shown watch people cry loved ones obvious emotional mostly big trick rope viewers feeling characters didnt work anyway actors much given leoni bad boys tvs naked truth best film given role character made stronger presence grow care robert duvall energetic fun watch character turned shreds plot elijah wood also comes rather successfully still hasnt many good roles wood stick drama talented stuff vanessa redgrave barely performance enhanced strong presence screen schell distracting provide nice humor morgan freeman infinitely better gives one shallow performances date quite remarkable leelee sobieski could better think suffered poorly written character special note go ron eldard denise eldard good role limited plot special personally tvs star trek next generation seeing one highlights film overall talented cast virtually wasted deep impact rated disaster related

theres least half dozen instances sheer technical good enough reasons director object must considered light extended cut dune offers several crucial areas changes involve cut scenes addition extra narration fill many holes original versions storyline pauls relationship father associates intimate moments humour warmth lacking previously political involving emperor two houses far better explained pauls way life also fleshed considerably background new prologue added featuring narration painted give us brief history dune universe piece storytelling tvs version dune clearly superior piece editing however times surprisingly inept use painted new prologue works well enough occasional appearance action begins inappropriate theres sloppy cutting instances shots even appear order use repeated footage certain scenes ships coming going soldiers coming going times clearly kind thing lynch rightly also noted several questionable scenes shots theatrical version deleted satisfy demands

thought stigmata would worst thriller released year turns wrong stigmata merely boring end days completely inept fronts silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess guy like grew watching arnold schwarzenegger best extremely disconcerting see big man ended first time recent memory arnold action movie batman robin doesnt count fun end days major stinker movie opens vatican city catholic priests observed ancient prophecy says girl born night satan targeted midnight december world destroyed pope orders protection girl though priests believe ought killed new york night girl born fulfill prophecy twenty years later meet jericho cane schwarzenegger suicidal excop drinking problem working security guard hire protecting local businessman gabriel byrne actually possessed devil assassination attempt businessman crazed former priest leads girl satan christine york robin tunney recognizing elements murdered daughter christine including ownership music box apparently jericho swears protect devil priests looking kill many problems film hard know begin starting concept casting arnold role like mistake begin schwarzenegger persona actor putting role usual strong personality bad idea arnold neither dramatic range speaking ability pull character tormented conflicting emotions words trying give dimension mistake harrison ford mel gibson even bruce willis could played role theyve played noble flawed heroes schwarzenegger several scenes attempt establish character one contemplating suicide another crying loss wife daughter even one devil tries revealing location offering old life back none scenes really work arnie isnt task filmmakers would better making jericho strong confident character like terminator example likes schwarzenegger one isnt believable way arnold plays supporting cast tries hardest gabriel byrne makes impact prince darkness hes suave confident acts like one would expect devil act problem script things make sense later undermines powerful villain byrne arnold every scene together including aforementioned temptation bit problematic causes audience start root devil byrnes speech bible overrated actually starts make sense mainly arnolds attempts mostly variety feeble best problem arnold win end nobody really cares kevin pollack plays security guard sidekick tries liven things comic asides like bad action movie sidekicks disappears hour robin tunney isnt given much except look scared fact supporting players good actors none save byrne given anything interesting performances aside would really hard enjoy film matter starred action blockbuster surprise worst thing script starts totally confusing explained much utterly ridiculous devil coming new years eve exactly years year devil isnt turns nutty priest accidentally read upside real year add beginning youve got dont buy explanation youre alone convoluted silly time method jericho christine york equally ludicrous shes christine see lives new york see werent bad enough theres plenty bothersome stuff film isnt explained satan kill everyone passes street comes one drunk excop hes powerless one kind bullet come cant control jericho christine monks deal time clumsy attempt joke made never actually explained usually sort thing wouldnt matter schwarzenegger flick mean dont get started time offered terminator movies time plot inconsistencies stand even usual action rarely exciting several predictable horror film clich present end days complete old black cat hiding cabinet bit ever find cat gets formulaic possible scared close eyes precise moment boo come rarely wrong grandiose action sequences utterly charmless partially dont care characters due scripts pathetic attempts characterization setup also dont make sense theres scene schwarzenegger gets thrown around room little old lady good chuckles much else supposedly believe super strength virtue controlled satan script never sets scene merely silly none terribly exciting action sequences badly framed often hard tell happening first place mention theyre edited incomprehensible mtv style scratching head rather saying wow cool end days silly confusing also distinctly unpleasant watch devil apparently doesnt operate subtle fashion bible instead enjoys killing people gruesomely broad daylight doesnt make awfully predictable sort also means single scene end days goes without unnecessarily graphic violence odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit scratching head violence supposed shocking good idea throw much movie audience goes numb scenes arent connected reasonable means lot time stuff gets blown people get killed idea reasons hell reasons lets blow stuff isnt cool nope long shot film thoroughly unwatchable dull interminable stupidity perhaps arnold needs make movies james cameron revive career happening hack peter hyams end days might camp value didnt top overly ending nobodys going buy movie going serious filmmakers come decent script going campy arnold shouldnt taking damn seriously didnt actually see put cross character shouldnt sad sack stands end days bad movie awfully gloomy one
